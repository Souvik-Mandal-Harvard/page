Please click on the folders and then on the zip files. Download the zip files on your computer. Once you unzip the files, you will find a .ipynb file inside.

Now, open Jupyter Notebook on your computer and navigate to the folder (technically called the "directory") containing the .ipynb file. Click on that. Here you go!
